I am Ellie Voyyd she/her, founder of [cybergrunge.net](https://cybergrunge.net). I am an Outsider Engineer, I am self-taught due to disability interfering with my ability to work and participate in school. So, this all might seem weird to "traditional" engineers and programmers. I also am somewhat insane and diagnosed with major depression, schizophrenia and several other things. I point this out because programming and engineering are feilds that disabled folks are often excluded from, due to the prevalence of unfounded and harmful [myths about the disabled](https://www.in.gov/spd/files/Myth.pdf). These feilds are also overwhelmingly male-dominated because of misogynistic myths. Differently Abled people can do everything that "normal" people can do, and providing [reasonable accomodations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility)  to differently-abled members of society not only does NOT harm "able-bodied" members of society, it is a practice which IMPROVES society and quality of life for ALL by encouraging empathy, compassion, consideration of alternative viewpoints, communication, collaboration and understanding. All of these are noble values.
